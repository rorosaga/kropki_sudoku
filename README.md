# üß© Kropki Sudoku Solver üß©

Welcome to the **Kropki Sudoku Solver**! This notebook demonstrates solving Kropki Sudoku puzzles using advanced algorithms and heuristics. Whether you're a Sudoku enthusiast or a fan of algorithmic problem-solving, you're in the right place!

## üîç What is Kropki Sudoku?

Kropki Sudoku is a variant of classic Sudoku with additional constraints:
- A white dot between two cells indicates their values differ by 1.
- A black dot between two cells means one value is twice the other.
- No dot? No such relationship exists between those cells.

The added complexity makes solving Kropki Sudoku a fascinating computational challenge!

## üõ†Ô∏è Features of the Solver

This solver incorporates:
- **Backtracking**: A systematic approach to explore all possible solutions.
- **Constraint Propagation**: Reduces the search space by applying logical constraints early.
- **Minimum Remaining Values (MRV) Heuristic**: Prioritizes cells with fewer possible values, optimizing the solving process.
